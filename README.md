This is a solution to the [5 Day Coding Challenge](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/) from the Code Institute. It is basically a challenge where you can learn the basics of coding with a free introductory course. Each day, for 5 days, you are given a new coding challenge to complete with tutorial videos and detailed notes. This was the first website I ever coded from scratch.

## Overview

### The challenge
